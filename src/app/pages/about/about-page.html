            My name is Danielle and I live in Tennessee with my dog (Maya), dwarf rabbit (Cocoa, who appears on stream from time to time), and a hermit crab (Kevin).
            Some of my favorites games include Resident Evil 2 & 4, the Splinter Cell series, Titanfall 2, the Onimusha series, P.T., and Mega Man X.
            When I'm not gaming, I work in web and UI design, paint, garden, and binge-watch Star Trek & Criminal Minds.

            I (mostly) stream horror games. However, you'll catch me playing other things from time to time, usually with friends. Join me for your daily dose of terror, thrills, and chills! ðŸ‘»
